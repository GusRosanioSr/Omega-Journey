# Omega-Journey
A game made using Python 3.4 and PyGame.
This game was made for my class Advanced Programming Workshop: PyGame.
All controls are with they arrow keys.
It involves four rooms.
The first room has two walls on the left and right, along wiht block the player must dodge.
The second room is a maze that the player must navigate through.
The third room is a "boss" room with a sprite that follows the player and tries to reset them to the beginging of the game.
Try and make it to the end if you can!!


IMPORTANT: In order to run this game you need to have Python 3.4 and Pygame installed on your machine.
